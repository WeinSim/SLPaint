<c>SLPaint

SLPaint (short for Simon - Linux - Paint) is a simple
image editing program for Linux, inspired by Microsoft
Paint.

I started this project in August of 2024.

SLPaint is still under development and has quite
some room for improvement:
- Text input is very basic
- There are a lot of small transparency bugs
- There are no icons (yet)
