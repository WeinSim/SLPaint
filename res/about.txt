<c>SLPaint

SLPaint (short for Simon - Linux - Paint) is a simple
image editing program for Linux, inspired by Microsoft
Paint. It is still under development and missing key
features such as proper file handling and support for
fonts other than the default font.

I started this project in August of 2024.
